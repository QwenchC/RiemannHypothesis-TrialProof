# RiemannHypothesis-TrialProof
This repository contains code and explanations for verifying the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann Zeta Function using numerical methods. Specifically, we use tools like Python and high-precision libraries to explore the distribution of these zeros and provide numerical evidence supporting the Riemann Hypothesis.
